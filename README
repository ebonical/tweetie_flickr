For use with Tweetie 2 and its new custom image service
http://developer.atebits.com/tweetie-iphone/custom-image

I currently have this running for my own personal use and I don't really
have any plans to make a public service out of it unless I get a lot
of interest in doing so. So the next best thing I thought to do would
be to provide the source and you can do what you want with it.

I pushed mine to http://heroku.com it's awesome.


Check list
==========

Create a user with twitter credentials
- if User#test_user is true then photos will be private (for testing)

Get Flickr user ID - try here http://idgettr.com

Get Flickr API key+secret
Put these into config/flickr.yml
Authenticate your Flickr account for write access
Get your token and store it against the user record

Set a secret session key for Rails in config/secret
- use `rake secret` to get a new key

POST to https://your-domain.com/photos.xml

Tweetie will send
:username
:password
:source ('tweetie')
:media
